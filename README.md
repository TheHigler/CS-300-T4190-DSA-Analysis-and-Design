What was the problem you were solving in the projects for this course?

The academic advisors for the Computer Science department at ABCU tasked us with creating an algorithm that would display and search for the courses found within the Computer Science program, display all the courses, and search for a specific course that would display the prerequisites needed to take the course. 


How did you approach the problem? Consider why data structures are important to understand.

I made notes of the clients requirements for the project to ensure I met their needs. Knowing the information the client need to display and sort, we were able to select the most appropriate structure to store and handle the data. The data structure we select is important as some structures are better at handling certain types of data over others. The different data structures will also search through information at different speeds. A program that needs quick searching abilities and where runtimes are more important, using vectors would be more appropriate over something like a hash table. 

How did you overcome any roadblocks you encountered while going through the activities or project?

When I crossed any roadblocks I found revisiting the ZyBooks material usually helped me figure out what I was missing. 

How has your work on this project expanded your approach to designing software and developing programs?

This project and the course in general, gave me an understanding of different data structures that can be used and how to use them appropriatley. I now have the tools to select the proper algorithm to store, search, and output data depending on the data needing to be stored and the clients needs. 

How has your work on this project evolved the way you write programs that are maintainable, readable, and adaptable?

This project, and the course as a whole, helped me effectivley implement vectors, hash tables, and binary trees while keeping the code succinct. Learning to properly implement each of the data stuctures was paramount in knowing how to keep the code maintainable, readable, and adaptable.
